<P>Title: Quantum non-demolition measurement of ultra cold atoms:
from spin-squeezing to real-time quantum control 
</P>
<P STYLE="page-break-before: always">Abstract 
</P>
<P>Quantum non-demolition (QND) measurement is an increasingly
important technique in atomic physics, with applications ranging from
atomic clocks and magnetometers, to the detection of strongly
correlated quantum phases of lattice gases. In particular, spin
squeezing via QND measurement has proved a successful strategy for
large entangled ensembles of atoms, suitable for applications in
quantum metrology. In our labs, we study the application of these
techniques to optical magnetometers. These devices are rapidly
approaching quantum limited sensitivity, and QND techniques are a
promising route for progress, with demonstrated advantage in
high-bandwith applications. I present our latest results, including
the first demonstration of spin squeezing for optical magnetometry, a
result which is non-trivial due to the multi-level atomic structure
involved, and an explicitly veri cation that we make a true QND
measurement according to the well-established criteria originally
developed in optical QND measurements, which, surprisingly, has never
been done in any material system. Currently we are working on
developing techniques for real-time quantum control of the collective
atomic spin state. This is a collaborative effort, with theoretical
support from the UPV. The goal is to produce a highly-entangled
macroscopic singlet state of an ensemble of up to one million atoms
via QND measurement and real-time feedback control of the collective
atomic spin. I report on our progress, with preliminary results
indicating that we can cool (i.e. reduce the entropy of) an arti
cially noisy spin state towards a well-de ned quantum state.

Department<BR>Title: Twin Matter Waves for Interferometry Beyond the
Classical Limit<BR>Abstract: Interferometers with atomic ensembles
are an integral part of modern<BR>precision metrology. However, these
interferometers are fundamentally<BR>restricted by the shot noise
limit, which can only be overcome by<BR>creating quantum entanglement
among the atoms. I will present our<BR>recent results concerning the
production of such states [1]. In the<BR>experiment performed at the
IQO in Hannover, spin-dynamics was<BR>used in a Bose-Einstein
condensate to create large ensembles of up<BR>to 10^4 pair-correlated
atoms with an interferometric sensitivity<BR>beyond the shot noise
limit. I will discuss the physical mechanism<BR>employed for the
state creation as well as the special challenges<BR>connected to
interferometry with large atom numbers.<BR><BR>[1] B. Lücke et al.,

methods<BR>Abstract: <BR>Tight Bell inequalities are facets of
Pitowsky's correlation polytope and are usually obtained from its
extreme points by solving the hull problem. Recently, Avis, Imai, Ito
and Sasaki have proposed an alternative method, based on variable
elimination, which overcomes some of the computational difficulties
of the hull problem. However, this method can only be applied to the
bipartite case. Here we present an algebraic derivation of the
half-space representation for a family of convex polytopes, from
which every correlation polytope can be obtained as a projection. As
a result, variable elimination methods, e.g. the Fourier-Motzkin
method, can be applied to obtain tight Bell inequalities in an
n-party scenario. Similar ideas are shown to be applicable to a
different kind of algebraic conditions. In particular, this analysis
provides an explanation for the fact that only a finite number of
families of Bell inequalities arise in scenarios where one
experimenter can choose between an arbitrary number of measurements.</P>

determine if given quantum systems are in entangled or separable
states is often required before any entanglement-based quantum
information processing, in particular measurement-based quantum
computation or quantum communication. In this talk, I would like to
approach to the practical problem from a fundamental observation on
impossible quantum operations, and address a related conjecture: any
physical approximation to optimal positive maps (that precisely
separates entangled from separable states) must be based on measuring
quantum states. I will then explore its application to entanglement
determination, and also discuss the quality assessment for the
implementation.</SPAN></P>

frequency combs and few-cycle pulses<BR>Abstract:<BR>The rapid
advance of femtosecond laser technology has enabled the construction
of several novel lasers that can be used as frequency combs or

tools for ultrahigh-precision frequency metrology in the optical
domain (Nobel-prize in Physics, 2005). The main application of
few-cycle optical fields is the generation of isolated attosecond
pulses and other ultrafast light-matter interaction processes.</P>

Quantum non-demolition measurements of cold atoms and
quantum-enhanced atomic sensing<BR>Abstract:<BR>Atomic ensembles,
collections of many identical atoms, are interesting systems for
studying the quantum physics of light-matter interactions. The
ensemble behaves as a macroscopic quantum system, interacting
strongly with the light field and robust against the loss or
decoherence of individual atoms in the ensemble. Using laser-cooled
rubidium-87 in an optical dipole trap, we demonstrate an atomic
ensemble with very strong light-matter interactions (an effective
optical depth of ~50 with only 10^6 atoms). Using paramagnetic
Faraday rotation to probe the spin polarization, we demonstrate
quantum non-demolition measurement with quantum-limited sensitivity.
In parallel, we develop quantum light sources suitable for atomic
probing. I will discuss applications to entanglement generation,
atom-based magnetometry and possibly more exotic topics such as
non-linear measurements that 'beat' the 1/N Heisenberg scaling limit.
