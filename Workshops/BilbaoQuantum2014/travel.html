        <h2>Bilbao is in Spain, the currency is Euros (€), power sockets are CEE 7 / Europlugs</h2>

        <p>
            By train:<br />
            The central train station <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilbao-Abando_railway_station">Abando</a> is well located at the centre of the city, and conveniently linked to all the public transport options operating within
            Bilbao (see below). Long distance lines arrive to Bilbao from Barcelona and Madrid and other main cities. Check the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilbao-Abando_railway_station">Abando</a> and
            <a href="https://www.renfe.com/es/es">RENFE</a> web pages for information about lines and schedules. There is another train company, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renfe_Feve">FEVE</a> (official webpage in Spanish here),
            which links Bilbao to all the cantabric coast line to the west, to Asturias. The FEVE station is, in fact, next to the Abando station.
        </p>

        <p>
            By bus:<br />
            Several long distance (as well as local) busses arrive to Bilbao at the main bus station Termibus. See its wikipedia page <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilbao_Intermodal">here</a> for further information. Termibus is perfectly connected to the Bilbao public transport net (see
            below).
        </p>

        <p>
            By plane:<br />
            Bilbao Airport is directly connected to some main European cities, such as Barcelona, Frankfurt, Lisbon, London, Madrid, Munich and Paris. Check either the official web page of Bilbao Airport or its
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilbao_Airport">wikipedia webpage</a> for details about flights, airlines and services.
        </p>

        <p>
            To and from the airport:<br />
            Bilbao Airport is about 12 Km from Bilbao, and it is very well connected to the city: The journey takes around 15 minutes and costs about 18€. The bus line 3247 (operated by BizkaiBus) connects Bilbao centre–Moyúa square, with
            Metro station–and the city bus station Termibus with the airport. In October, <b> the bus runs every 30 minutes, from 5:25 am to 21:55 from Bilbao to the airport, and from 6:15 am to 24:00 from the airport to Bilbao</b>. The journey
            takes 15 minutes to Moyúa and 20 minutes to Termibus. A single ticket costs 1.30€.
        </p>

        <p>
            Local transport:<br />
            Apart from the taxis, public transport in Bilbao is managed by<br />
            BilboBus city buses net, which covers all the Bilbao area and most of its surroundings<br />
            Metro (underground/tube/metro/u-bahn)<br />
            Euskotran, the tram, which links the area around Termibus with most of the amenities in Bilbao up to the old town.
        </p>

        <p>Both the central train station <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilbao-Abando_railway_station">Abando</a> and the main bus station Termibus are connected to the three means of transport: underground, tram and bus.</p>
