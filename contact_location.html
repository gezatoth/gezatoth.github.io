<p><img src="Map_UPVEHU_Leioa_Spain_annotated.png" name="Image2" align="bottom" width="770" height="398" border="0"/></p>
<p><strong>Theoretical Physics Department</strong>: After you are at the main entrance of sciences, go straight until you can. Then, turn left, and again, go straight until you can, even when crossing iron doors. Then, you are at a staircase. Go down two levels, and you are at level -2, Department of Theoretical Physics. It is on the ground floor, the reason for the -2 is that the building is on a hill side.</p>
<p><strong>Our offices</strong>: they are not at the department. The way to get there is as follows: enter the main entrance. Turn left immediately when you can. Go on the corridor until you reach the end. There is a staircase. Go up one level and continue on the same direction, as you were walking in the long corridor. Go until you can. At some point you can proceed slightly left and right. Choose slightly left. My office is A6.P1.4.</p>
