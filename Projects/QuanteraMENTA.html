<h3>Accessible Quantifiers of Multipartite Entanglement in Atomic Systems</h3>

<p>The characterization and classification of multipartite entanglement is crucial for the investigation of many-body systems, foundational problems and quantum technologies. A central goal of the MENTA project is to discover robust, experimentally accessible criteria to witness and explore the many facets of quantum correlations. Multipartite entanglement provides formidable challenges arising from the exponential increase of the HIlbert space dimension with the  number of the quantum system constituents. For instance, the full classification of multipartite entanglement is missing in the literature, and the possibility to witness the classes of entangled states allowing quantum advantages in different quantum information applications is still largely unexplored.</p>

<p>The experimental groups in this project have substantial infrastructure permitting the use of ultra-cold atoms and their detection. The techniques include: coherent spin manipulation, atom chips, Bose-Einstein condensates, atom interferometry and arrays of optical tweezers. They have already developed powerful atom detection techniques with: high quantum efficiency, a capacity for the detection of multiple atoms and their correlations as well as good spatial resolution, all of which will be used to develop experimental protocols for witnessing multipartite entanglement.</p>

<p>A crucial asset is the dedicated collaboration of two theoretical groups to guide the exploration of the many possible experimental strategies to make these characterizations. The high degree of experimental control and detection efficiencies will permit the evaluation of Fisher information the Dyson rank and other multipartite entanglement witnesses based on the measurement of collective variables. Significant efforts will be dedicated to investigate novel quantifiers specifically tailored to the experimental platforms created in this project. Successful completion of this project will provide to the community a deeper understanding of multipartite entanglement and its relation with fundamental and technological applications.</p>

<h4>Motivation</h4>

<p>The characterization and classification of multipartite entanglement is crucial for the investigation of many-body systems,
foundational problems and quantum technologies. A central goal is to discover robust, experimentally accessible criteria to
witness and explore the many facets of quantum correlations. Multipartite entanglement provides formidable challenges arising
from the exponential increase of the Hilbert space dimension with the number of the quantum system constituents. For instance,
the full classification of multipartite entanglement is missing in the literature, and the possibility to witness the classes of
entangled states allowing quantum advantages in different quantum information applications is still largely unexplored.</p>

<h4>Multipartite entanglement Concepts (Forence, Bilbao)</h4>

<p>- Entanglement depths and related concepts, and their detection (Florence)</p>
<p>The entanglement depth is not the only quantitier of multipartite entanglement and that further parameters are needed.
   Very recenily, the so-called Dyson rank has been
suggested, which is defined as <i>r= w - h</i>, where <i>w</i> is the quantum information processing and <i>h</i> is the number of separable partitions.</p>

<p>- Detection of bipartite entanglement in large particle ensembles (Bilbao)</p>
<p> We can divide the collection of atoms into spatially separated entangled sub-ensembles. This step is important for the unltracold gas community, since quantum information processing and even Bell inequality tests need spatially separated qudits.</p>
